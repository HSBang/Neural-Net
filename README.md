# Neural-Net
Implementation of a neural net. There are three major functions used in this program: /n
Compute_cost: Implement forward propagation in this method and then calculate the cross-entropy loss to determine the cost of the neural net. /n
Predict: Implement forward propagation to make a prediction based on current model parameters. /n
Fit: Using the method discussed in the article "Implementing a Neural Network from Scratch in Python: An Introduction",  implement a good fit function using forward propagation, back propagation, and updating the model parameters by using gradients.
